# Understanding Stocks: A Beginner's Guide

## What is a Stock?

A stock represents ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, making you a shareholder. Companies issue stocks to raise money for growth, operations, and other business activities.

## How Stocks Work

When a company goes public through an Initial Public Offering (IPO), it sells shares to investors. After the IPO, these shares trade on stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ. The stock price fluctuates based on supply and demand, company performance, and market conditions.

## Types of Stocks

### Common Stock
- Most typical type of stock
- Gives shareholders voting rights at company meetings
- Dividends are not guaranteed but may be paid
- Higher potential returns but also higher risk

### Preferred Stock
- Generally no voting rights
- Fixed dividend payments (similar to bonds)
- Priority over common stockholders if company liquidates
- Less price appreciation potential

## Key Stock Metrics

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
The P/E ratio compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share. A higher P/E might indicate investors expect higher growth, while a lower P/E might suggest the stock is undervalued or the company faces challenges.

**Formula:** P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share

### Market Capitalization
Market cap represents the total value of a company's outstanding shares.

**Formula:** Market Cap = Stock Price × Number of Outstanding Shares

**Categories:**
- Large-cap: Over $10 billion
- Mid-cap: $2 billion to $10 billion
- Small-cap: Under $2 billion

### Dividend Yield
Shows how much a company pays out in dividends relative to its stock price.

**Formula:** Dividend Yield = Annual Dividends Per Share / Stock Price

## How to Make Money from Stocks

1. **Capital Appreciation:** Buy low, sell high. If you buy a stock at $50 and sell at $75, you've made $25 per share.

2. **Dividends:** Some companies distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders as dividends, typically quarterly.

## Risks of Stock Investing

- **Market Risk:** Overall market declines can affect all stocks
- **Company Risk:** Individual company problems can hurt specific stocks
- **Volatility:** Stock prices can fluctuate significantly in short periods
- **Loss of Principal:** You can lose some or all of your investment

## Getting Started with Stock Investing

1. **Open a brokerage account:** Choose a reputable broker with low fees
2. **Start with research:** Understand any company before investing
3. **Diversify:** Don't put all your money in one stock
4. **Think long-term:** Short-term trading is risky for beginners
5. **Invest regularly:** Consider dollar-cost averaging

## Important Terms

- **Bull Market:** A market experiencing rising prices
- **Bear Market:** A market experiencing falling prices (typically 20%+ decline)
- **Volume:** Number of shares traded in a given period
- **Bid/Ask:** Bid is what buyers will pay; ask is what sellers want
