# Roth IRA: What It Is and How to Open One

*Source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp)*

- A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax dollars, allowing both growth and qualified withdrawals (after age 59½ and after 5 years) to remain tax-free.

- You can withdraw your contributions at any time—tax-free and without penalty, even if you haven’t met the 5-year or age requirements.

- Roth IRAs are optimal if you expect your marginal tax rate to be higher in retirement than now.

- Single tax filers cannot contribute to a Roth IRA in 2024 if their modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is more than $161,000 ($165,000 in 2025), while for married couples filing jointly, the limit is $240,000 ($246,000 in 2025).

- Contribution limits for 2025 are $7,000, or $8,000 if you are age 50+; eligibility phases out based on MAGI (e.g., $165,000 single / $246,000 married).

- Roth IRAs don’t require mandatory distributions (RMDs) during your lifetime, making them practical tools for long-term wealth transfer.

A Roth IRA is a type of tax-advantaged individual retirement account to which you can contribute after-tax dollars toward your retirement. Known as an individual retirement arrangement by the IRS, the primary benefit of a Roth IRA is that your contributions and the earnings on those contributions can grow tax-free and be withdrawn tax-free after age 59½, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. In other words, you pay taxes on money going into your Roth IRA, and then all future withdrawals are tax-free. The features of a Roth IRA account can vary between providers, and you should compare the best Roth IRA accounts before making a choice.

Roth IRAs are like traditional IRAs, but the difference lies in how they are taxed. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars. Unlike a traditional IRA, the contributions are not tax-deductible, but once you start withdrawing funds, the money you take out is tax-free.

## How Does a Roth IRA Work?


You can put money you've already paid taxes on into a Roth IRA. Your earnings are tax-free if you make a qualified withdrawal at age 59½ or later and after owning the Roth IRA for five years. You can withdraw contributions without tax or penalty at any time.

A Roth IRA can be funded from multiple sources:

- Regular contributions

- Spousal IRA contributions

- Rollover contributions

All Roth IRA contributions must be made in cash (which includes checks and money orders) unless they are rollover contributions. They can’t be in the form of securities or property. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limits how much can be deposited annually in any type of IRA, adjusting the amounts periodically. The contribution limits are the same for traditional and Roth IRAs. These limits apply across all your IRAs, so even if you have multiple accounts, you can't contribute more than the maximum.

Similar to other qualified retirement plan accounts, the money invested in a Roth IRA grows tax-free. However, a Roth IRA is less restrictive than other accounts. The account holder can maintain the Roth IRA indefinitely. There are no required minimum distributions (RMDs) during their lifetime, as there are with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.

Conversely, traditional IRA deposits are generally made with pretax dollars. You usually get a tax deduction on your contribution and pay income tax when you withdraw the money from the account during retirement.


## Allowable Investments in a Roth IRA


Once you have contributed money to a Roth IRA, you can put it to work by investing in a variety of securities, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), certificates of deposit (CDs), and money market funds.

Prohibited investments include life insurance, collectibles, coins (except certain coins minted by the U.S. Treasury), and S-corp stock. “There is no rule against investing your IRA in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency," Ed Slott, founder of IRAHelp.com, told Investopedia.

If you want the broadest range of investment options, you need to open a Roth self-directed IRA (SDIRA), a special category of Roth IRA in which the investor, not the financial institution, manages their investments. These unlock a universe of possible investments, including directly investing in digital assets.

“Roth IRAs that can hold cryptocurrency, as well as other unusual assets, are typically available through certain self-directed IRA custodians," said Eric Satz, founder and chief executive of Alto, a self-directed IRA platform that provides access to alternative assets. Those specialized self-directed custodians are equipped to manage the unique custody and compliance requirements associated with cryptocurrency investments and provide access to the 24/7 liquidity markets as expected by most crypto investors.”

In addition to the standard investments (stocks, bonds, cash, money market funds, and mutual funds), you can hold assets that aren’t typically part of a retirement portfolio in such self-directed Roth IRAs. Some of these include gold, investment real estate, partnerships, and tax liens—even a franchise business.

However, just because you’re allowed to invest in cryptocurrency doesn't make it a good idea. In a traditional IRA, cryptocurrency can generate distributions that get taxed as short-term ordinary income, Slott said. That entails a higher tax rate than long-term capital gains.

Equally bad, if the IRA owner is under age 59½, an additional 10% early distribution penalty can apply, Slott said.

“Crypto makes more sense in a Roth IRA," Slott said. "With Roth IRAs, if the holding rules are followed, any earnings can be distributed tax-free. If a crypto investment appreciates significantly, that could be a substantial tax-free windfall for a Roth IRA owner’s golden years.

“Nevertheless, there are serious concerns that must be addressed when it comes to investing an IRA in crypto. First, IRA owners cannot contribute crypto to an IRA. They must contribute cash. Then the crypto would be purchased within the IRA. Additionally, investments in cryptocurrency face the same issues that other alternative IRA investments encounter. Most IRA custodians will limit available investment choices to firm-approved stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and CDs.”

So your IRA custodian—the Fidelitys and Vanguards of the investment world—could bar digital assets from your Roth or traditional IRA.

The maximum annual contribution that an individual can make to a Roth IRA in 2025. People age 50 and older can contribute up to $8,000.

A Roth IRA must be established with an institution that has received IRS approval to offer IRAs. These include banks, brokerage companies, federally insured credit unions, and savings and loan associations. Generally, individuals open IRAs with brokers.

A Roth IRA can be established anytime. However, contributions for a tax year must be made by the IRA owner’s tax-filing deadline, which is normally April 15 of the following year.

Two basic documents must be provided to the IRA owner when an IRA is established:

- IRA disclosure statement

- IRA adoption agreement and plan document

These provide an explanation of the rules and regulations under which the Roth IRA must operate, and they establish an agreement between the IRA owner and the IRA custodian/trustee.

Not all financial institutions are created equal. Some IRA providers have an expansive list of investment options, while others are more restrictive. Almost every institution has a different fee structure for Roth IRAs, which can have a significant impact on investment returns.

Your risk tolerance and investment preferences will play a role in choosing a Roth IRA provider. If you plan on being an active investor and making lots of trades, you want to find a provider that has lower trading costs. On the other hand, certain providers charge you an account inactivity fee if you leave your investments alone for too long. Some providers have more diverse stock or ETF offerings than others; it all depends on what type of investments you want in your account.

Pay attention to the specific account requirements as well. Some providers have higher minimum account balances than others. If you plan on banking with the same institution, see if your Roth IRA account comes with additional banking products. If you’re looking at opening a Roth IRA at a bank or brokerage where you already have an account, see whether existing customers receive any IRA fee discounts.

Most IRA providers offer only regular IRA (traditional or Roth) accounts. For a self-directed IRA, you’ll need a qualified self-directed IRA custodian who specializes in that type of account, which allows assets beyond the typical stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.


## Compare the Best Roth IRA Accounts



## Are Roth IRAs Insured?


If your account is located at a bank, be aware that IRAs fall under a different insurance category from conventional deposit accounts. Therefore, coverage for IRA accounts is not as robust. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) still offers insurance protection up to $250,000 for traditional or Roth IRA accounts, but account balances are combined rather than viewed individually.

For example, if the same banking customer has a CD held within a traditional IRA with a value of $200,000 and a Roth IRA held in a savings account with a value of $100,000 at the same institution, then the account holder has $50,000 of vulnerable assets without FDIC coverage.


## What Can You Contribute to a Roth IRA?


The IRS dictates not only how much money you can deposit in a Roth IRA but also the type of money that you can deposit. Basically, you can only contribute earned income to a Roth IRA.

For individuals working for an employer, compensation that is eligible to fund a Roth IRA includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and other amounts paid to the individual for the services that they perform. It’s generally any amount shown in Box 1 of the individual’s Form W-2. For a self-employed individual, a partner, or a member of a pass-through business, compensation is the individual’s net earnings from their business, less any deduction allowed for contributions made to retirement plans on the individual’s behalf, and further reduced by 50% of the individual’s self-employment taxes.

Money related to divorce—alimony, child support, or in a settlement—can also be contributed if it is related to taxable alimony received from a divorce settlement executed prior to Dec. 31, 2018.

So, what sort of funds aren’t eligible? The list includes:

- Rental income or other profits from property maintenance.

- Pension or annuity income.

- Stock dividends and capital gains.

- Passive income earned from a partnership in which you do not provide substantial services.

You can never contribute more to your IRA than your earned income in that tax year. And as previously mentioned, you receive no tax deduction for the contribution—although you may be able to take a Saver's Tax Credit of 10%, 20%, or 50% of the deposit, depending on your income and life situation.


## Who’s Eligible for a Roth IRA?


Anyone who has earned income can contribute to a Roth IRA—as long as they meet certain requirements concerning filing status and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Those whose annual income is above a certain amount, which the IRS adjusts periodically, become ineligible to contribute.

Here’s how the system works: If your income falls below the limit for your category, you can contribute up to 100% of your earnings or the maximum limit—whichever is lower.

Individuals within the phaseout range must subtract their income from the maximum level and then divide that by the phaseout range to determine the percentage that they are allowed to contribute.

The table below shows the income qualifications for 2025.

One way that a couple can boost their contributions is with a spousal Roth IRA. An individual may fund a Roth IRA on behalf of their married partner, who earns little or no income. Spousal Roth IRA contributions are subject to the same rules and limits as regular Roth IRA contributions. The spousal Roth IRA is held separately from the Roth IRA of the individual making the contribution, as Roth IRAs cannot be joint accounts.

For an individual to be eligible to make a spousal Roth IRA contribution, the following requirements must be met:

- The couple must be married and file a joint tax return.

- The individual making the spousal Roth IRA contribution must have eligible compensation.

- The total contribution for both spouses must not exceed the taxable compensation reported on their joint tax return.

- Contributions to one Roth IRA cannot exceed the contribution limits for one IRA (however, the two accounts allow the family to double their annual savings).


## Withdrawals: Qualified Distributions


At any time during the tax year, you may withdraw contributions from your Roth IRA, both tax and penalty-free. If you take out only an amount equal to the sum that you’ve put in, then the distribution is not considered taxable income and is not subject to penalty, regardless of your age or how long it has been in the account.

However, there’s a catch when it comes to withdrawing account earnings—any returns that the account has generated. For the distribution of account earnings to be considered a qualified distribution, it must occur at least five years after the Roth IRA owner established and funded their first Roth IRA, and the distribution must occur under at least one of the following conditions:

- The Roth IRA holder is at least age 59½ when the distribution occurs.

- The distributed assets are used toward purchasing—or building or rebuilding—a first home for the Roth IRA holder or a qualified family member (the IRA owner’s spouse, a child of the IRA owner or of the IRA owner’s spouse, a grandchild of the IRA owner and/or of their spouse, or a parent or other ancestor of the IRA owner or of their spouse). This is limited to $10,000 per lifetime.

- The distribution occurs after the Roth IRA holder becomes disabled.

- The assets are distributed to the beneficiary of the Roth IRA holder after the Roth IRA holder’s death.

Withdrawal of earnings may be subject to taxes and/or a 10% penalty, depending on your age and whether you’ve met the five-year rule. Here’s a quick rundown.

If you meet the five-year rule:

- Under age 59½: Earnings are subject to taxes and penalties. You may be able to avoid taxes and penalties if you use the money for a first-time home purchase (a $10,000 lifetime limit applies) or if you have a permanent disability. If you pass away and your beneficiary takes the distribution, taxes and penalties may also be avoided.

- Ages 59½ and older: There are no taxes or penalties.

If you don’t meet the five-year rule:

- Under age 59½: Earnings are subject to taxes and penalties. You may be able to avoid the penalty (but not the taxes) if you use the money for a first-time home purchase (a $10,000 lifetime limit applies), qualified education expenses, unreimbursed medical expenses, if you have a permanent disability, or if you pass away and your beneficiary takes the distribution.

- Ages 59½ and older: Earnings are subject to taxes but not penalties.

Roth IRA withdrawals are made on a first in, first out (FIFO) basis—so any withdrawals made come from contributions first. Therefore, no earnings are considered touched until all contributions have been taken out.


## Withdrawals: Non-Qualified Distributions


If you withdraw earnings that don't meet the requirements above, it is considered a non-qualified distribution and may be taxed or incur a 10% early distribution penalty.

There may be exceptions, however, if the funds are used:

- For unreimbursed medical expenses: If the distribution is used to pay unreimbursed medical expenses for amounts that exceed 7.5% of the individual’s adjusted gross income (AGI).

- To pay medical insurance: If the individual has lost their job.

- For qualified higher education expenses: If the distribution goes toward qualified higher education expenses of the Roth IRA owner and/or their dependents. These qualified expenses are tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for the enrollment or attendance of a student at an eligible educational institution and must be used in the year of the withdrawal.

- For childbirth or adoption expenses: If they're made within one year of the event and don't exceed $5,000.

Note that if you withdraw only the amount of your contributions made within the current tax year—including any earnings on those contributions—then the contribution is reversed. For example, if you contribute $5,000 in the current year and those funds generate $500 in earnings, you can withdraw the $5,000 principal tax and penalty-free, and the $500 gain will be treated as taxable income.


## Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA


Whether a Roth IRA is more beneficial than a traditional IRA depends on the tax bracket of the filer, the expected tax rate at retirement, and personal preference.

Individuals who expect to be in a higher tax bracket once they retire may find the Roth IRA more advantageous since the total tax avoided in retirement will be greater than the income tax paid in the present. Therefore, younger and lower-income workers may benefit the most from a Roth IRA.

Indeed, by beginning to save with an IRA early in life, investors make the most of the snowballing effect of compound interest: Your investment and its earnings are reinvested and generate more earnings, which are reinvested, and so on.

Of course, even if you expect to have a lower tax rate in retirement, you’ll still enjoy a tax-free income stream from your Roth IRA. That’s not the worst situation in the world.

Those who don’t need their Roth IRA assets in retirement can leave the money to accrue indefinitely and pass the assets to heirs tax-free upon death. Even better, while the beneficiary must take distributions from an inherited IRA, they can stretch out tax deferral by taking distributions for a decade—and, in some specialized cases, for their lifetimes—if the Roth IRA’s original owner died in 2020 or later.

Traditional IRA beneficiaries, on the other hand, do pay taxes on the distributions. Also, a spouse can roll over an inherited IRA into a new account and not have to begin taking distributions until age 73.

Roth IRAs inherited before 2020 can still use what’s often called the stretch IRA strategy. That approach lets heirs “stretch” the inherited Roth IRA withdrawals over their lifetimes, allowing the IRA to continue building up earnings tax-free, potentially for decades. However, the SECURE Act eliminated the stretch option for most beneficiaries except spouses.

Some people open or convert to Roth IRAs because they fear an increase in taxes in the future, and this type of IRA allows them to lock in the current tax rates on the balance of their conversions. Executives and other highly compensated employees who can contribute to a Roth retirement plan through their employers—for example, via a Roth 401(k)—can also roll these plans into Roth IRAs with no tax consequence and then escape having to take mandatory minimum distributions when they turn 73.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)



## Is It Better to Invest in a Roth IRA or a 401(k)?


There are many variables to consider when choosing a Roth IRA or a 401(k) retirement account. Each type of account provides an opportunity for savings to grow tax-free. Roth IRAs do not provide tax advantages when you make a deposit, but you can withdraw tax-free during retirement. The same applies to Roth 401(k) accounts.

The reverse is true for regular or traditional 401(k)s. These types of accounts involve contributing a portion of your paycheck to a 401(k) prior to income tax deductions. And in terms of annual contribution limits, Roth IRAs are typically much lower than 401(k)s.

Additionally, 401(k)s allow employers to make matching contributions. On the flip side, 401(k)s often have higher fees, minimum distributions, and fewer investment options.


## How Much Can I Put in My Roth IRA Monthly?


In 2025, the maximum annual contribution amount for a Roth IRA is $7,000, or $583.33 monthly for those under age 50. This amount increases to $8,000 annually, or roughly $666.67 monthly, for individuals age 50 or older.

The only limit in any year is the annual one. We cite the monthly breakdown just to put the annual cap into a monthly perspective.

In comparison, the 2025 contribution limit for a regular or a Roth 401(k) account is $23,500. If you are 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a catch-up contribution for 2025.


## What Are the Advantages of a Roth IRA?


While Roth IRAs do not include an employer match, they allow for a greater diversity of investment options. For individuals who anticipate being in a higher tax bracket when they’re older, the tax-free withdrawals of Roth IRAs can be beneficial.

Also, you can withdraw your Roth IRA contributions (but not earnings) at any time, tax and penalty-free. You can manage how your Roth IRA is invested by opening an account with a brokerage, bank, or qualified financial institution.


## What Are the Disadvantages of a Roth IRA?


Among the disadvantages of Roth IRAs is the fact that, unlike 401(k)s, they do not include an upfront tax break. Secondly, annual contribution limits are about a third of 401(k)s, and for some high-income individuals, contributions are either reduced or not allowed.

A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account (IRA) that allows you to withdraw money (without paying a penalty) on a tax-free basis after age 59½ and after you have owned the account for its five-year holding period. If you buy a home, pay for college, or need your Roth funds for the birth or adoption of a child, you can also withdraw without paying a penalty.

Roth accounts are funded with after-tax money, so while you don't get the upfront tax break of a traditional IRA, you can withdraw your contributions without paying federal or state income tax on the amount after meeting the criteria for withdrawals.

For individuals who anticipate that they will be in a higher tax bracket when they are older or have retired, Roth IRAs can provide a beneficial option, as the money is not taxable if you’ve met the time requirements, unlike withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA.


## Is a Roth IRA All You Need?


Roth IRA benefits are powerful. You can take tax and penalty-free withdrawals once you are old enough and have owned the account long enough. You are also exempt from penalty on withdrawals if you qualify. And you are eligible if you take out no more than $10,000 to buy a first home, to name one legal loophole.

Another Roth IRA perk is the ability to pay an income tax rate that may be lower now on the money that goes into a Roth IRA than on money you withdraw years from now in retirement. That benefit hinges on your expectation coming true–that you have a higher tax rate in retirement when you’ve amassed more wealth.

All those points can be true, but that does not mean a Roth IRA is the only type of retirement savings account you should have.

“Having different types of accounts is advantageous because it gives you tax liability diversification,” said Ed Slott, founder of IRAHelp.com.

For one thing, that diversification prevents you from putting all of your future income into one tax basket. That’s even more valuable if a fickle Congress once again changes tax rules. After all, what if Congress kills or dilutes the tax-free pass that withdrawals from Roth IRAs enjoy for now?

“What good is it to plan, sacrifice, and save if you don't know whether the government is going just to make unforeseeable changes and take money away from you?" Slott said.

For another thing, what if your expectation of having a higher tax rate in retirement than you do now turns out wrong?

Further, other retirement savings accounts have benefits that Roth IRAs do not offer. To cite one big one, 401(k) accounts almost always give you a company match.


## Retirement Security Rule: What It Is and What It Means for Investors


The purpose of the Retirement Security Rule, also known as the fiduciary rule, is to protect investors from conflicts of interest when receiving investment advice that the investor uses for retirement savings.

The rule was issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) on Apr. 23, 2024 and took effect on Sept. 23, 2024. However, a one-year transition period delayed the effective date of certain conditions to 2025.

If an advisor acts as a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), they are subject to the higher standard—the fiduciary best-advice standard—rather than the lower, merely suitable advice standard. Their designation can limit the products and services they are allowed to sell to clients who are saving for retirement.
