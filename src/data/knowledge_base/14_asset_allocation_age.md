# Asset Allocation by Age: Building the Right Portfolio

## What is Asset Allocation?

Asset allocation is how you divide your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash). It's the most important decision in investing, determining most of your portfolio's risk and return.

## Why Age Matters

Your age affects your:
- **Time horizon:** How long until you need the money
- **Risk capacity:** Ability to recover from losses
- **Income needs:** Current vs. future income requirements

**Key Principle:** You can take more risk when young because you have time to recover from market downturns.

## Traditional Age-Based Rules

### The "100 Minus Age" Rule
Subtract your age from 100 to get your stock allocation.

**Example:**
- Age 30: 100 - 30 = 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- Age 50: 100 - 50 = 50% stocks, 50% bonds
- Age 70: 100 - 70 = 30% stocks, 70% bonds

### The "110 Minus Age" Rule (Updated)
Given increased longevity and low bond yields, some suggest using 110 or even 120.

**Example:**
- Age 30: 110 - 30 = 80% stocks
- Age 50: 110 - 50 = 60% stocks

### The "Age in Bonds" Rule
Your age equals your bond percentage.

- Age 30: 30% bonds, 70% stocks
- Age 50: 50% bonds, 50% stocks

## Allocation Guidelines by Decade

### In Your 20s
**Time Horizon:** 40+ years to retirement

**Suggested Allocation:**
- Stocks: 80-100%
- Bonds: 0-20%
- Cash: Emergency fund only

**Why:** Maximum time to compound. Can weather multiple market cycles.

**Sample Portfolio:**
- 60% US Total Stock Market (VTI)
- 25% International Stocks (VXUS)
- 15% Bonds (BND)

### In Your 30s
**Time Horizon:** 30+ years to retirement

**Suggested Allocation:**
- Stocks: 75-90%
- Bonds: 10-25%

**Why:** Still have long horizon, but may have more obligations (mortgage, family).

**Sample Portfolio:**
- 55% US Total Stock Market
- 20% International Stocks
- 5% REITs
- 20% Bonds

### In Your 40s
**Time Horizon:** 20+ years to retirement

**Suggested Allocation:**
- Stocks: 65-80%
- Bonds: 20-35%

**Why:** Peak earning years, balancing growth with protection.

**Sample Portfolio:**
- 45% US Total Stock Market
- 20% International Stocks
- 5% REITs
- 30% Bonds

### In Your 50s
**Time Horizon:** 10-15 years to retirement

**Suggested Allocation:**
- Stocks: 55-70%
- Bonds: 30-45%

**Why:** Need to start protecting wealth while still growing.

**Sample Portfolio:**
- 40% US Total Stock Market
- 15% International Stocks
- 5% REITs
- 40% Bonds

### In Your 60s (Pre-Retirement)
**Time Horizon:** 5-10 years to retirement

**Suggested Allocation:**
- Stocks: 45-60%
- Bonds: 35-50%
- Cash: 5-10%

**Why:** Sequence of returns risk is highest. Protect near-term needs.

**Sample Portfolio:**
- 35% US Total Stock Market
- 10% International Stocks
- 45% Bonds
- 10% Cash/Short-term

### In Retirement (65+)
**Time Horizon:** Could be 30+ years!

**Suggested Allocation:**
- Stocks: 30-50%
- Bonds: 40-60%
- Cash: 5-15%

**Why:** Need growth to fight inflation but stability for withdrawals.

**Sample Portfolio:**
- 30% US Total Stock Market
- 10% International Stocks
- 50% Bonds
- 10% Cash

## The Glide Path Concept

A glide path is the gradual shift from aggressive to conservative over time.

### Example Glide Path:
| Age | Stocks | Bonds |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 25 | 90% | 10% |
| 35 | 80% | 20% |
| 45 | 70% | 30% |
| 55 | 60% | 40% |
| 65 | 50% | 50% |
| 75 | 40% | 60% |

### Target-Date Funds
Automatically follow a glide path:
- Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 (VFIFX)
- Fidelity Freedom 2050
- Schwab Target 2050

**One-fund solution:** Buy target-date fund matching your retirement year.

## Factors Beyond Age

### Risk Tolerance
- High tolerance: More aggressive than age suggests
- Low tolerance: More conservative than age suggests

### Pension or Social Security
- Guaranteed income acts like bonds
- Can be more aggressive with investments

### Health and Life Expectancy
- Longer expected life: Can take more risk
- Health concerns: May need more accessible funds

### Wealth Level
- Higher wealth: Can afford more risk
- Just enough for retirement: Need to protect it

### Other Income Sources
- Rental income, side business: More flexibility
- Single income source: More conservative

## Stock Allocation Within Stocks

### US vs. International
Common split: 60-70% US, 30-40% International

| Age | US Stocks | International |
|-----|-----------|---------------|
| 20s | 70% | 30% |
| 40s | 65% | 35% |
| 60s | 75% | 25% |

### Large Cap vs. Small Cap
Common split: 70-80% Large, 20-30% Small/Mid

Small caps have higher risk and return potential—appropriate for longer horizons.

## Bond Allocation Within Bonds

### By Type
- Total Bond Market: Core holding
- TIPS: Inflation protection
- Short-term: Stability
- International: Diversification

### By Duration
| Time Horizon | Preferred Duration |
|--------------|-------------------|
| 10+ years | Intermediate/Long |
| 5-10 years | Intermediate |
| Under 5 years | Short-term |

## Rebalancing Your Allocation

### Why Rebalance?
Market movements shift your allocation away from targets.

**Example:**
- Start: 70% stocks, 30% bonds
- After bull market: 80% stocks, 20% bonds
- Action: Sell stocks, buy bonds to return to 70/30

### When to Rebalance
- **Calendar:** Annually or semi-annually
- **Threshold:** When allocation drifts 5%+ from target
- **Life events:** Major changes in circumstances

## Common Allocation Mistakes

1. **Too conservative when young:** Missing decades of growth
2. **Too aggressive near retirement:** Risk of devastating losses
3. **Not adjusting over time:** 80% stocks at age 65
4. **Ignoring all stocks in retirement:** Still need growth
5. **100% employer stock:** Concentration risk
6. **Market timing:** Moving to cash during corrections

## Key Takeaways

1. Younger investors can take more risk
2. Gradually shift to conservative over time
3. Target-date funds automate the process
4. Consider personal factors beyond age
5. Rebalance periodically to maintain targets
6. Don't be too conservative in retirement—you may live 30+ years
