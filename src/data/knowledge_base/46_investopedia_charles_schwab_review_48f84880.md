# Charles Schwab Review

*Source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/charles-schwab-review-4587925)*

As one of the largest discount brokerages in the world, Charles Schwab provides a full-service approach for investors, employers, and independent advisors. As of November 2025, Charles Schwab had $11.59 trillion in client assets. Schwab has been busy integrating TD Ameritrade since purchasing it in late 2019. Managing customer growth and integrating TD Ameritrade’s technology has been a balancing act for Schwab; however, full integration has now been completed.

Schwab offers a vast amount of educational content for investors of all levels, and the company has made significant efforts to make more products and tools available to active traders and ESG investors. The biggest upgrade was, of course, the integration of TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim® trading platform into Schwab. Schwab is positioning thinkorswim® as the flagship trading platform, introducing 24-hour trading five days a week for a wide range of securities. Schwab’s customers span from long-term investors to beginning and sophisticated traders. Schwab has done an admirable job of tailoring its tools, education, and platforms to the different needs of these groups.

On July 21, 2025, Charles Schwab announced a significant expansion to the list of securities users of the company's thinkorswim platform can now trade overnight. Schwab retail clients can now trade more than 1,100 securities, which are primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 24 hours a day, five days a week using extended + overnight session orders (EXTO). EXTO orders are continuous orders that expire at 8pm ET each market day.

Chuck Schwab and his partners formed First Commander Corporation in April 1971 and changed the name of the company to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. in 1973. The mission of the company is to put the customer at the forefront using the “Through Clients’ Eyes” strategy. In October 2020, Schwab completed the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and has since fully integrated all TD Ameritrade accounts into the Charles Schwab ecosystem.

Charles Schwab has experienced continuous growth in recent years. When Schwab acquired TD Ameritrade in 2020, they were looking at a combined $5 trillion in client assets and 24 million customer accounts. Five years later, Schwab is more than double that size in terms of assets and now has over 38 million customer accounts. As a full-service broker, Schwab provides a robust collection of products and services for investors of any level. At the same time, though, it operates as a discount broker with commission-free stock and ETF trades.

Schwab has a vast asset universe that includes its own funds and fractional shares for S&P 500 stocks. One area it continues to hold out is with direct cryptocurrency investments, instead offering a range of indirect exposure. Schwab has always been a solid choice for retail investors with its vast educational offerings, excellent research tools, and low costs. The full integration of TD Ameritrade has made Schwab equally solid for active traders and given it one of the best trading platforms in the industry.

In addition to our review of Charles Schwab’s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.

- Multiple platforms for a diverse customer base: Schwab has multiple resources for a diverse customer base. Whether you are a new investor or an experienced one, Schwab provides educational resources, customizable platforms and tools, 24/7 customer service, flexible digital formats, top-notch analysis tools, and top-rated screeners.

- Excellent ETF research and scanners: To complement the company's top-tier offering of available ETFs, Schwab delivers some of the deepest research capabilities in the industry.

- Commission-free stock and ETF trading: Schwab offers free stock and ETF trading. Investors do not have to pay a fee to buy and sell online stocks and ETFs. As part of its order execution, Schwab focuses on improving pricing for 98% of investments.

- Robo-advisor and AI features: Schwab offers a robo-advisor and AI features. Schwab’s automated investing tool, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, is a digital investment manager (robo-advisor). Schwab offers a comprehensive educational overview of what a robo-advisor is, its functions, and how to determine if it is the right fit for you. Schwab offers AI-enhanced voice technology customer service support for advisors. Schwab's mobile app has an AI feature called Schwab Assistant, which allows customers to use voice commands to do things such as set alerts, make trades, find answers to their questions, and more.

- Available ESG ETF: Schwab offers an ESG ETF. In 2021, Schwab launched its first ESG fund, Schwab Ariel ESG ETF. The fund is also Schwab’s first active ETF and is sub-advised by Ariel Investments. A benefit of this fund is that Ariel Investments assigns proprietary ESG-risk ratings to each company in the fund.

- Higher margin rates: Schwab has higher margin rates than some of its competitors. The current base rate is 10.25% as of November 2025, and the effective rates currently range between 10.325% to 12.075%.

- No fractional-share ETF trades: Schwab does not offer fractional-share trading for ETFs. The company does offer Schwab Stock Slices, which allow customers to buy fractional shares of stock in any company within the S&P 500.

- No direct investments in cryptocurrencies: For cryptocurrency investors, Schwab offers several indirect crypto investing options, such as spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, rather than crypto spot trading.

- Low interest on uninvested cash: Schwab has an automated sweep feature that puts cash into an account that yields 0.05%. This is less than the cash sweep into money market mutual funds that other brokers offer, with yields closer to 4%.

Competition is strong among online brokers. Schwab remains a top performer because the company continues to take in customer feedback and make improvements. Depending on the type of account you want to open, it can take up to 20 minutes to open an account online. Navigating through the various platforms is not complicated for investors of any level. There are various tools on Schwab’s software, mobile, and web platforms.

The platforms include:

- The Schwab.com website

- The Schwab Mobile trading app

- thinkorswim® is a customizable trading software that is available to download on desktops or as a web-based version. thinkorswim® also has a dedicated mobile app

- Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, the robo-advisor

No matter which platform customers use, they have the ability to check their portfolio performance, deposit checks using any mobile device, receive alerts and push notifications, get breaking news, and make trades. Schwab also creates a holistic experience by allowing its customers to see all of their assets on its site. This includes assets outside of Schwab’s platform, as it provides a free aggregation.

Customers will find many helpful tools and resources to help them navigate through the various platforms that Schwab offers. Innovative technology makes the experience better, with access to features such as real-time data streams and the capability to convert screening results to a watchlist.

Charting capabilities at Schwab have improved with the integration of thinkorswim, adding key indicators like a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) tool. In addition, thinkorswim's chart analysis features include trend lines and other popular drawing tools along with a much deeper level of customization, making it ideal for options traders and other heavy trading users. The ability to chart on the Schwab website is more limited, but customers are still able to achieve what is needed to help them make decisions.

Trade orders can be staged for later entry, and you can trade directly from charts. For users of the Schwab mobile app, however, the ability to draw on and place other charting tools on charts is not available. This is no longer a big issue, however, as the thinkorswim mobile app provides these features.


## Mobile Trade Experience


Having access to your Schwab accounts through a mobile app is convenient. The Schwab mobile app is somewhat limiting because not all of the features in the web platform are available in the app. There are some limitations on the types of trading orders you can make.

Security features in the mobile app use the latest biometric technology. Customers can access their accounts using Face ID, their fingerprint, or a preset passcode. Customers can also make a check deposit in the app by taking photos and following the instructions in the app to process the deposit. Customers select the account they want to make the deposit into, enter the amount of the deposit, take a photo of the front and back of the check, review the deposit to verify everything is correct, and the photos are clear, and then submit.

The mobile app defaults to the summary view, which shows brokerage and futures totals. From there, you can either click on an account or click on positions from the menu at the top left. On the Markets page, you can see an index graph and can change the available time frames to see the difference in the graph. On this page, you can also see how the investment is performing on various indexes and stock exchanges, and much more.

Traders will, of course, prefer the thinkorswim mobile app, which is a full-featured mirror of the web and desktop versions. You can trade all the same assets with all the same orders and drawing tools on the mobile app as you can on the powerful desktop version. The thinkorswim platforms are also the only way to access Nasdaq Level 2 data and paper trading features. Currently, mutual funds and fixed income are limited to the Schwab.com and Schwab mobile platforms, and futures and forex are only available on the thinkorswim trio. Stocks, ETFs, and options are available across all platforms.

As a full-service broker, Schwab offers a diverse range of investments. Schwab continues to add to its existing offerings as technology advances and the demand for other investments, such as ESG investments, increases.

Schwab’s offerings include:

- Exchange-traded Funds (Schwab has several ETFs in various asset classes)

- Mutual funds (Schwab offers no-load, no transaction-fee mutual funds)

- International stocks (equity trading is available for over 30 global markets, and customers can trade in seven currencies across 12 global markets)

- Automated investing through Schwab Intelligent Portfolios (automated investing using a robo-advisor)

Like other large brokerages, Charles Schwab also creates its own funds. Schwab is always adding to its ETF lineup, launching an actively managed bond ETF earlier in 2025.

Charles Schwab offers all the basic order types, including market, limit, stop, and trailing stops. It also offers market-if-touched (MIT), market-on-close (MOC), and market-on-open (MOO) type orders. Additionally, Schwab offers all-or-none (AON), fill-or-kill (FOK), and immediate-or-cancel (IOC) orders. Customers can use the thinkorswim platform for more advanced orders, such as a limit order with an OCO contingent order.

Charles Schwab uses a proprietary wheel-based router, providing price improvement for its order management process. This includes real-time execution quality reviews, oversight of exchange outages, and monitoring of volatile markets.

Some stock orders and options listed on multiple exchanges are routed to third-party wholesalers. This allows Schwab to maintain its position in price improvement and provide customers with cost savings. Schwab’s retail execution quality statistics for the third quarter of 2025 indicate an average execution of 0.05 seconds for S&P 500 stocks, with 98% of orders having price improvements.

Charles Schwab provides customers with detailed information on the costs of its products and services. An added benefit is that customers have access to a wealth of educational resources, news, and research amenities from research firms, such as Morningstar and Argus, which can be accessed for free. The company has a track record of reducing fees to keep up with the competition. Schwab does not have the lowest margin trading fees among its competitors, so margin traders may need to do a cost versus benefits analysis to make decisions on this service.

- No commissions for online listed stocks, ETFs, or options (base commission).

- Options are $0.65 per contract. Multiple-leg options have fees, and the SEC assesses an exchange process fee; Schwab charges this fee to the customer.

- Fixed income: No commission for Treasury bonds, Treasury notes, and Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). There is a $1 commission for secondary market bonds, such as corporate and municipal bonds. The commission range is $10 minimum to $250 maximum.

- Margin rates are based on the debit balance in your account plus Schwab’s base rate. Schwab’s current market rates are kept up to date and shared on the company website. As of November 2025, the base margin rate is 10.25%, and depending on the debit balance, it can range between 12.075% and 10.325%.

- Mutual Funds: There is no commission on mutual funds in Schwab’s Mutual Fund OneSource platform; however, a transaction fee of up to $74.95 applies to all other mutual funds.

- International stocks: There is a fee of $6.95 for trades on Canadian exchanges. There is a $50 foreign transaction fee for foreign stock trades placed on the American over-the-counter (OTC) market.

- Futures and futures options are $2.25 per contract.

- There are various fees and minimums required for certain accounts. There is no fee and no required account minimum for basic accounts. There are some management fees and minimums for investment accounts, such as Schwab Intelligent Portfolios accounts. There are no commissions or advisory fees for the basic Schwab Intelligent Portfolios account, but there is a $5,000 account minimum. The Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium account has a one-time $300 fee, a $30 monthly advisory fee, and an account minimum of $25,000. The fee for the Schwab Wealth Advisory account starts at 0.80% and decreases the higher the amount of assets in the account, and there is a $1 million minimum. For the Schwab Advisor Network account, fees vary by advisor, and the account minimum is $500,000.

- There are no fees to transfer funds, but there are fees to wire funds from your Schwab accounts. The wire transfer fee is $25, but if the transfer is completed online, the fee is $15.

- There is a $25 service charge for broker-assisted trades for most of the basic accounts.

- There are no maintenance, inactivity, or software access fees.

- There are no fees to make deposits or withdrawals or to close an account (other than ACAT cost).


## How This Broker Makes Money From You and For You


Charles Schwab was one of the first online brokers to offer commission-free trades for stocks and ETFs. This caused some fierce competition in the industry for other brokers to do the same. Now, investors don’t have to pay fees to buy and sell shares, but you should be aware that there are still indirect costs associated with trading. Brokers still have to make money in some way.

- Payment for order flow (PFOF): Although Schwab has commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs, there are still costs associated with other types of investments and services. Schwab receives payments for order flow (PFOF). These are rebates from liquidity providers and various exchanges. Schwab discloses these payments in its Report of Routing Customer Orders. The most recent report for the third quarter of 2025 is available. The period we looked at showed around $0.001 per share of PFOF for stocks and $0.60 for complex options orders. The stock number is on the low side, while the option PFOF is above average for the brokers we assessed.

- Portfolio margining: Some Schwab accounts qualify for portfolio margining, which allows customers to maintain overall margin costs and risks for their portfolios. Schwab’s margin rates are not the lowest of its competitors.

- Securities lending: Customers who join the Securities Lending Fully Paid program can offer shares to a stock loan program and receive part of the income generated through loaning the stock.

- Interest on cash balances: Schwab earns interest on the excess amount of cash held in customers’ accounts. The cash is deposited into regular bank accounts rather than money market funds. The bank account deposits are insured at levels that are higher than FDIC levels through insurance policies that Schwab has with Lloyds of London. Customers can earn higher interest on money market funds and should monitor their accounts to ensure their funds are placed in these accounts rather than regular bank accounts that earn lower interest.

- Price improvement: Charles Schwab’s Order Execution Advantage is how it meticulously monitors the quality of its order execution process. Schwab is a leader in executing orders at prices that are better than the National Best Bid and Offer (NBB) market prices. Schwab reports its price improvement is 98%, and average execution speed ranges from 0.05 seconds. According to Schwab, its customers received $595 million in price improvement on equity and option orders in the third quarter of 2025.


## Account and Research Amenities


Charles Schwab is one of the foremost brokerage firms, with offerings for a diverse customer base. The company offers a wide-ranging collection of services and support for its customers. Schwab has extensive research capabilities. Customers have access to some of the industry’s best proprietary and third-party research, both at no extra charge. Some of the third-party research organizations are Morningstar, Argus, and CFRA. Schwab’s ETF research is so strong that the company has won our Best ETF Screeners category for the past several years.

Charles Schwab has screeners with advanced features such as pre-built screening reports. Customers can create customized stock screens based on various criteria such as dividend yield, price performance, analyst ratings, financial strength, and more. On Schwab.com, there is a plethora of built-in screens for stocks/equities, and thinkorswim brings even more pre-built stock screening reports.


## ETF and Mutual Fund Screeners


Schwab’s ETF screeners are best-in-class. On the Schwab website, customers have access to 17 built-in ETF screens and 11 screens for mutual funds. A great feature of the ETF and mutual fund screeners is the capability to screen for socially responsible investments (SRI). You can also customize screens using various other criteria. Schwab also has a Schwab Select List where customers can search prescreened mutual funds.

Charles Schwab offers two types of options screeners: customizable screeners and predefined screeners. With the customizable screeners, customers can use specific criteria, such as volatility or assigned rate of return. Some of the criteria in the customizable screeners are the same ones used in the stock screeners.

The predefined screeners have 10 predefined strategies, but customers can modify them as needed. Customers can use the trade assessor to find trades based on their own assessment of an investment using various criteria such as profit percentage, maximum gain or loss, or assigned rate of return. Customers can also place orders within the results. Full Option Chains allow customers to view real-time quotes.

Thinkorswim's options screening capabilities have now come over to Schwab in more or less a complete package. This includes tools like Spread Hacker and Options Hacker that allow you to build screens as simple or complex as you'd like. Here again, serious traders will gravitate to thinkorswim as their platform of choice.


## Fixed Income Screeners


The fixed income screener allows customers to select a bond type, such as corporate, municipal, or Treasury. Customers can use secondary menus to review bonds based on industry, sector, or state. Additional filtering options are available, such as maturity dates, price, and ratings. Schwab also has a CD and treasury ladder builder, and customers can also screen bond ETFs.


## Tools and Calculators


Schwab customers have access to numerous tools and calculators to meet their needs. These tools and calculators cover a wide range of components, including tax efficiency, portfolio analysis, allocation, pricing, and retirement. Additionally, customers can easily access various reports such as tax-related reports.

Schwab now has thinkorswim, which means beginners and sophisticated traders will find a fully customizable platform for charting. This includes adjusting charts for color, size, strategy, time period, and more. You can layer indicators as you desire and have this work appear on mobile and web-based platforms as well. The charting on the regular platform is sufficient for most investors with some basic features, but thinkorswim will be the platform of choice for traders.


## Trading Idea Generator


The Idea Hub at Schwab has largely been retired. Investors can still obtain ideas about different areas of the market by utilizing predefined screens. Some of the criteria in the screens are volatility, earnings calendar, and volume. However, thinkorswim has a deeper feature set for scanning and executing different ideas and strategies.

On any Schwab platform, customers can enjoy an enhanced CNBC feed and get streaming news, information, and quotes. In the mobile app, customers can get real-time breaking news and market data. Associated Press, Business Wire, GlobeNewswire, and briefing.com are among the offerings. Other news and research is also available for a fee, and many of these services have extended trial periods available.

All of Schwab’s platforms have a research component, including third-party research organizations, such as Moody’s and Morningstar. Additionally, customers can find analyst ratings for investments.

Charles Schwab offers two cash management options for customers: savings and investment cash and everyday cash. The savings and investment cash options are a high-yield savings account, money market fund accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). The everyday cash options are uninvested cash in your Schwab brokerage and retirement accounts and a high-yield checking account that is linked to a Schwab One brokerage account.

Some accounts have a sweep feature, but not exactly as you’d like. Some money market fund accounts have a sweep feature; however, Schwab no longer offers the sweep feature for most new and existing accounts. For accounts with a sweep feature, excess funds are not automatically swept into the accounts unless you set it up. Schwab’s bank sweep feature for employee benefit plans automatically sweeps excess funds into a Schwab Trust Bank account.


## Fractional Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)


Schwab customers can determine whether or not they want to reinvest the dividends they earn from their dividend-paying investments. Schwab allows customers to make fractional dividend reinvestments rather than requiring enough cash to buy a full share.


## SRI/ESG Research Amenities


Schwab has options for customers who are seeking socially responsible investments (SRI). Schwab’s advanced mutual fund and ETF screeners have an SRI filter. Using the SRI filter, customers can create customized searches that limit their results to socially responsible investments. Schwab also has separately managed accounts that focus on socially responsible investing.

Charles Schwab has an array of portfolio analysis tools, including various calculators. Account balances are available on all of Schwab’s platforms. All account balances and portfolio performance analyses are in real time. A portfolio performance analysis tool, Portfolio Checkup, is available on the Schwab website. The good news is that customers can integrate external accounts into the Portfolio Checkup tool. Additionally, customers can use the tool to compare their portfolio’s returns to market targets, perform risk-return analysis, and check the performance of individual investments.

Customers can also maintain a trading journal and use thinkorswim for backtesting. Customers looking for robo-advisors and AI features can use Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, an automated investing tool that uses a robo-advisor. The robo-advisor consistently monitors your portfolios and automatically rebalances them when necessary.

Charles Schwab provides a wide range of educational resources in various formats, including webinars, articles, videos, and live branch events. The educational resources span multiple trading and investing topics. Podcast lovers will be happy to know that Schwab produces two podcasts, Choiceology and Financial Decoder.

Schwab offers the Schwab Starter Kit, which allows new investors to receive top-notch investment education while receiving $101 when they open and fund an account. Schwab Live Daily is an online collaboration with existing thinkorswim celebrities that is live-streamed on the Schwab website Monday through Friday at 10 a.m. ET. The show is hosted by Schwab employees who specialize in various areas of investing and trading.

For anyone who may be overwhelmed by all the information on the website, help is not far away. Schwab has 24/7 customer service available by phone or live chat. Schwab Assistant is available on the mobile app, allowing customers to use voice commands to find needed information or get answers to questions. Most product pages have FAQs and links to additional information and resources.

- Customer service is available by phone, chat with a live person 24/7, and at physical branches.

- Customers can speak with a financial advisor or a broker for broker-assisted trades. There is a fee for this service, and pricing is based on the type of trade.

- The chat feature provides helpful and timely support. We had a pleasant customer service experience through chat. It took less than two minutes for a live representative to connect after we entered the information and submitted it.

- Most of the product pages on the website have a Common Questions section near the bottom of the page. There are also links to additional information and resources.

- Schwab offers a satisfaction guarantee for customers. If a customer isn’t satisfied with services received, Schwab will refund eligible fees associated with the customer’s dissatisfaction. Eligible fees include program fees, commission fees, and other fees that are listed in Schwab’s pricing guide.


## Security and Reliability


Schwab’s platforms are secured to meet industry standards.

- Two-factor authentication is available on the Schwab website and mobile app. Customers can access their accounts on the mobile app using their fingerprint, face ID, or a preset passcode.

- Schwab’s voice ID feature allows customers to use their voice to access their accounts. Customers only have to say, “At Schwab, my voice is my password.” Voice ID uses biometric voice technology that stores a digital version of a customer’s voice using a proprietary algorithm.

- Schwab experienced a security breach between May and December 2021 and began sending out letters in March 2022 to inform customers about the breach.

- Schwab also experienced an incident in 2023 that affected less than 0.5% of customers.

Schwab provides detailed, clear information on its pricing structures and fees. The broker also provides deeper details about the specific investing costs associated with each type of investment. An explanation of each type of cost is provided, along with a breakdown of the costs that Schwab customers incur. Schwab even lets everyone see how they stack up against their competitors using comparison charts. Website visitors can see the comparison in pricing, service, choice, and trading.

Schwab dedicates a whole section to information about margins and margin loans. In this section, you will find videos explaining what margin trading is and the benefits and risks of margin trading, a hypothetical example that includes both gain and loss scenarios and a scenario without margin, Schwab’s current margin rates, Schwab’s margin requirements, common questions, and more. Schwab also provides updates on its adjustments to margin requirements.

Schwab provides details about its order routing process, including its focus on putting the customer first and getting the best execution through its proprietary order routing system. Schwab discloses its real-time price improvement and payment for order flow (PFOF) data in its Report of Routing Customer Orders.


## Available Account Types


Charles Schwab has a multitude of accounts and services to meet the needs of a new investor or an experienced one. Based on your specific needs and goals, you can certainly find an account that will fit into your plans. There are 12 overall account types, covering everything from trading to saving for education, and Schwab provides details about each account type and their benefits.

Schwab’s account types include:

- Global (access to 12 international markets in local currency)

- Traditional individual retirement account (IRA)

- Simplified employee pension (SEP) IRA

- Individual and business 401(k) plan

- 529 college savings plan and education savings account (ESA)

Charles Schwab is a top-rated brokerage offering services and products to customers online and at its branches. Schwab meets the needs of every type of investor, including active traders, those who only want to use robo-advisors, and anyone who is passionate about investing in socially responsible companies.

Schwab's integration of thinkorswim stacks up nicely against some of the top offerings for sophisticated investors and traders. There are still some steps undone, like the lack of direct access to cryptocurrency trading, but overall, Schwab is now a solid option for the more active investment crowd.

A new investor may get overwhelmed by all the content provided on the Schwab website, but there is no shortage of high-quality assistance available through multiple methods. Although Schwab provides many valuable solutions, there is still room for improvement as the broker does not offer fractional shares trading for ETFs, its margin rates are higher than other brokers’ rates, and it does not have an automated sweep to money market funds feature for excess funds. However, Schwab is taking the right steps to remain a top online broker and a solid choice for any investor.
