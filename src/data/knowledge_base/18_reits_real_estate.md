# REITs: Real Estate Investing Without the Hassle

## What is a REIT?

A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-producing real estate. REITs allow you to invest in real estate without buying physical property.

## How REITs Work

### Legal Requirements
To qualify as a REIT, a company must:
- Invest at least 75% of assets in real estate
- Derive at least 75% of income from real estate
- Distribute at least 90% of taxable income as dividends
- Have at least 100 shareholders
- Be managed by a board of directors/trustees

### Why High Dividends?
Because REITs must distribute 90% of income, they typically pay higher dividends than average stocks (4-6% yield).

## Types of REITs

### Equity REITs (Most Common)
Own and operate properties, earning income from rent.

**Examples:**
- Office buildings
- Shopping malls
- Apartments
- Warehouses

### Mortgage REITs (mREITs)
Provide financing for real estate by purchasing mortgages or mortgage-backed securities.

**Characteristics:**
- Higher yields (8-12%)
- More sensitive to interest rates
- Higher risk

### Hybrid REITs
Combine both equity and mortgage strategies.

## REIT Sectors

### Residential
Apartment buildings, single-family rentals, manufactured housing.
- Example: AvalonBay (AVB), Equity Residential (EQR)

### Commercial Office
Office buildings and business parks.
- Example: Boston Properties (BXP)

### Retail
Shopping centers, malls, freestanding retail.
- Example: Simon Property Group (SPG), Realty Income (O)

### Industrial
Warehouses, distribution centers, logistics facilities.
- Example: Prologis (PLD), Duke Realty

### Healthcare
Hospitals, medical offices, senior housing.
- Example: Welltower (WELL), Ventas (VTR)

### Data Centers
Facilities housing computer systems.
- Example: Digital Realty (DLR), Equinix (EQIX)

### Cell Towers
Wireless communication infrastructure.
- Example: American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI)

### Self-Storage
Storage unit facilities.
- Example: Public Storage (PSA), Extra Space Storage (EXR)

## Why Invest in REITs?

### Benefits

**1. Income**
- High dividend yields (4-6% average)
- Regular income stream
- Good for retirees

**2. Diversification**
- Low correlation with stocks and bonds
- Real estate exposure without buying property
- Multiple property types and locations

**3. Inflation Hedge**
- Rents typically rise with inflation
- Property values tend to keep pace with inflation

**4. Liquidity**
- Buy and sell like stocks
- No closing costs or property management
- Fractional ownership possible

**5. Professional Management**
- Experienced operators handle properties
- No landlord responsibilities

### Risks

**1. Interest Rate Sensitivity**
- REITs often decline when rates rise
- Higher rates make bonds more attractive vs. REIT yields

**2. Economic Sensitivity**
- Recessions hurt occupancy and rents
- Some sectors more cyclical (retail, office)

**3. Sector-Specific Risks**
- Retail: E-commerce disruption
- Office: Remote work trends
- Hotels: Travel downturns

**4. Dividend Cuts**
- Dividends can be reduced during tough times
- 2020 saw many hotel/retail REIT cuts

## REIT Taxation

### Regular Taxable Account
REIT dividends are mostly taxed as **ordinary income** (not qualified dividends).

**Example:**
- REIT dividend: $1,000
- Tax bracket: 24%
- Tax owed: $240

vs. Qualified dividend at 15% = $150

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts
Hold REITs in IRA or 401(k) to defer taxes:
- No annual tax on dividends
- Traditional: Taxed at withdrawal
- Roth: Tax-free withdrawals

**Recommendation:** Hold REITs in tax-advantaged accounts when possible.

## REIT Metrics

### Funds From Operations (FFO)
Net income + depreciation - gains on property sales

More accurate than earnings for REITs because real estate depreciation is an accounting charge, not real cash expense.

### Adjusted FFO (AFFO)
FFO adjusted for capital expenditures. Shows sustainable cash flow.

### Price to FFO (P/FFO)
REIT equivalent of P/E ratio.
- Average: 15-18x
- Lower = potentially cheaper
- Higher = potentially expensive

### Net Asset Value (NAV)
Estimated value of all properties minus debt.
- Trading below NAV = potential bargain
- Trading above NAV = possible premium

### Dividend Yield
Annual dividend / share price
- Average REIT yield: 4-6%
- High yield may signal risk

### Occupancy Rate
Percentage of space that's rented.
- Higher is better
- 90%+ is generally healthy

## How to Invest in REITs

### Individual REITs
Buy shares of specific REIT companies through a brokerage.

**Pros:** Target specific sectors/companies
**Cons:** Requires research, less diversified

### REIT ETFs

| VNQI | International REITs | 0.12% |
| SCHH | US REITs | 0.07% |
| RWR | US REITs | 0.25% |

### REIT Mutual Funds

**Example Portfolio:**

### Overlap with Index Funds
