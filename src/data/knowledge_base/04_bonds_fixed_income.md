# Understanding Bonds and Fixed Income

## What is a Bond?

A bond is essentially a loan you make to an entity (government or corporation). In return, the borrower promises to pay you interest at regular intervals and return your principal when the bond matures.

## How Bonds Work

1. **Issuer** sells bond to raise money
2. **Investor** buys bond (lends money)
3. **Coupon payments** are made periodically (usually semi-annually)
4. **Principal** is returned at maturity

### Bond Terminology

- **Face Value (Par):** The amount paid back at maturity (typically $1,000)
- **Coupon Rate:** The annual interest rate paid on the bond
- **Maturity Date:** When the bond expires and principal is repaid
- **Yield:** The return you'll earn if you hold the bond to maturity

## Types of Bonds

### Government Bonds

**Treasury Securities (US Government)**
- **Treasury Bills (T-Bills):** Short-term (4-52 weeks), sold at discount
- **Treasury Notes:** Medium-term (2-10 years), pay semi-annual interest
- **Treasury Bonds:** Long-term (20-30 years), pay semi-annual interest
- **TIPS:** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, adjust for inflation
- **I Bonds:** Inflation-protected savings bonds, bought directly from Treasury

**Municipal Bonds (Munis)**
- Issued by state/local governments
- Often tax-exempt (federal, sometimes state/local)
- Good for high-income investors in taxable accounts

### Corporate Bonds

**Investment Grade**
- Rated BBB/Baa or higher
- Lower risk, lower yield
- Issued by financially stable companies

**High-Yield (Junk) Bonds**
- Rated BB/Ba or lower
- Higher risk, higher yield
- Issued by companies with weaker financials

## Bond Ratings

Credit rating agencies assess the likelihood of default:

| Rating (S&P/Moody's) | Quality |
|---------------------|---------|
| AAA/Aaa | Highest quality |
| AA/Aa | High quality |
| A/A | Upper medium |
| BBB/Baa | Medium grade |
| BB/Ba | Speculative |
| B/B | Highly speculative |
| CCC/Caa and below | Substantial risk |

## Bond Prices and Interest Rates

**The Inverse Relationship:**
When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. When rates fall, bond prices rise.

**Why?**
If you own a bond paying 3% and new bonds pay 5%, your bond becomes less attractive, so its price drops.

### Example
- You buy a $1,000 bond paying 4% ($40/year)
- Interest rates rise to 6%
- Your bond's price drops to ~$667 so the $40 payment equals ~6% yield

## Bond Yield Concepts

### Current Yield
```
Current Yield = Annual Coupon Payment / Current Bond Price
```

### Yield to Maturity (YTM)
Total return if held to maturity, accounting for:
- Coupon payments
- Price paid vs. face value
- Time to maturity

### Yield Curve
Plots yields across different maturities:
- **Normal:** Long-term yields higher (upward sloping)
- **Inverted:** Short-term yields higher (often predicts recession)
- **Flat:** Similar yields across maturities

## Bond Duration

Duration measures a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes.

**Higher duration = More price volatility**

- Short-term bonds: Lower duration, less sensitive to rate changes
- Long-term bonds: Higher duration, more sensitive to rate changes

## Why Include Bonds in Your Portfolio?

### Benefits
1. **Steady income:** Regular coupon payments
2. **Lower volatility:** Less price fluctuation than stocks
3. **Diversification:** Often move opposite to stocks
4. **Capital preservation:** Return of principal at maturity
5. **Deflation protection:** Fixed payments worth more if prices fall

### Risks
1. **Interest rate risk:** Prices fall when rates rise
2. **Inflation risk:** Fixed payments lose purchasing power
3. **Credit risk:** Issuer may default
4. **Liquidity risk:** May be hard to sell some bonds

## Bond Strategies

### Laddering
Buy bonds with staggered maturities:
- Reduces interest rate risk
- Provides regular access to principal
- Example: Equal amounts in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-year bonds

### Barbell Strategy
Concentrate in short-term AND long-term bonds:
- Short-term: Liquidity and stability
- Long-term: Higher yields

### Target-Duration Matching
Match bond duration to when you need the money:
- College in 5 years? Consider 5-year duration
- Reduces impact of interest rate changes

## Bond Allocation by Age

Traditional guidance suggests more bonds as you age:

| Age | Stock Allocation | Bond Allocation |
|-----|-----------------|-----------------|
| 30 | 80-90% | 10-20% |
| 40 | 70-80% | 20-30% |
| 50 | 60-70% | 30-40% |
| 60 | 50-60% | 40-50% |
| 70+ | 40-50% | 50-60% |

*These are general guidelines; your situation may vary.*

## How to Buy Bonds

### Individual Bonds
- Through a broker
- Treasury Direct for government bonds
- Minimum investments often $1,000+

### Bond Funds (Easier for Most Investors)
- **Bond ETFs:** BND, AGG, VGIT
- **Bond Mutual Funds:** VBTLX, PIMCO Total Return
- Instant diversification
- Professional management
- Lower minimums

## Key Takeaways

1. Bonds provide stability and income
2. Understand the inverse relationship with interest rates
3. Consider bond funds for diversification
4. Match bond duration to your time horizon
5. Include both government and corporate bonds for diversification
