# RSUs and Stock Compensation: Complete Guide

## What are RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)?

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) are a form of equity compensation that companies grant to employees. An RSU is a promise to give you shares of company stock (or cash equivalent) once certain conditions are met, typically a vesting schedule.

## How RSUs Work

1. **Grant:** Your employer grants you a certain number of RSUs
2. **Vesting:** RSUs vest over time (typically 3-4 years)
3. **Delivery:** Once vested, you receive actual shares or their cash value
4. **Taxation:** You owe taxes when RSUs vest, not when granted

## RSU Vesting Schedules

### Cliff Vesting
- Nothing vests until a specific date (usually 1 year)
- Then a large portion vests at once
- Example: 25% vests after 1 year, then monthly thereafter

### Graded Vesting
- Shares vest gradually over time
- Example: 25% per year over 4 years

### Common Schedule (4-Year with 1-Year Cliff)
- Year 1: 25% vests after 12 months (cliff)
- Years 2-4: Remaining 75% vests monthly or quarterly

## RSU Taxation

### When Are RSUs Taxed?
RSUs are taxed as **ordinary income** when they vest, not when granted.

### Tax Calculation
```
Taxable Income = Number of Vested Shares × Fair Market Value on Vest Date
```

### Tax Withholding Methods
1. **Sell to Cover:** Employer sells some shares to pay taxes
2. **Net Settlement:** Company withholds shares equal to tax owed
3. **Cash Payment:** You pay taxes separately (less common)

### Example
- You have 100 RSUs vesting
- Stock price on vest date: $150/share
- Vest value: $15,000
- Assuming 35% tax rate: $5,250 in taxes
- With "sell to cover": ~35 shares sold, you keep ~65 shares

## RSUs vs. Stock Options

| Feature | RSUs | Stock Options |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Value at Grant | Has value immediately | No value until stock price rises |
| Exercise Required | No | Yes, must pay exercise price |
| Taxation | At vesting | At exercise (for NSOs) or sale (for ISOs) |
| Risk | Lower (always has value) | Higher (can expire worthless) |
| Ownership | Receive actual shares | Right to buy shares |

## RSU Strategies

### Diversification
**Risk:** Having too much wealth tied to employer stock

**Strategy:** Sell vested RSUs and diversify into other investments. Financial advisors often recommend no more than 10-15% of your portfolio in any single stock.

### Tax Planning
- **Timing:** If possible, negotiate start dates to optimize vesting timing
- **Withholding:** Ensure enough is withheld to avoid tax surprises
- **Estimated Taxes:** May need to make quarterly estimated tax payments

### When to Sell
Consider selling RSUs when:
- Your employer stock exceeds 10-15% of your portfolio
- You need the funds for a specific goal
- You're concerned about company performance

## Capital Gains After Vesting

Once RSUs vest, the shares become regular stock. Any future gains or losses are subject to capital gains rules:

- **Short-term gains** (held less than 1 year): Taxed as ordinary income
- **Long-term gains** (held more than 1 year): Lower capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20%)

### Cost Basis
Your cost basis is the fair market value on the vest date (since you already paid taxes on that amount).

**Example:**
- RSUs vest at $100/share (you paid tax on this)
- You sell later at $150/share
- Capital gain = $50/share

## Common RSU Mistakes

1. **Not planning for taxes:** RSU vesting creates a tax bill
2. **Concentration risk:** Too much wealth in employer stock
3. **Ignoring the cliff:** Leaving before cliff means losing unvested RSUs
4. **Forgetting about 83(b) elections:** Not applicable to RSUs (only restricted stock)
5. **Emotional attachment:** Making decisions based on company loyalty vs. financial sense

## RSU Considerations When Changing Jobs

- **Unvested RSUs are forfeited** when you leave
- Consider negotiating RSU buyouts with new employer
- Time your departure strategically (after major vesting events)
- Factor lost RSUs into compensation negotiations

## Tracking Your RSUs

Keep records of:
- Grant dates and amounts
- Vesting schedule
- Fair market value at each vesting date
- Shares sold and sale prices
- Tax documents (W-2 includes vested RSU income)
