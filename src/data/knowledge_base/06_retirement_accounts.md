# Retirement Accounts: 401(k), IRA, Roth, and More

## Overview of Retirement Accounts

Retirement accounts offer tax advantages to encourage saving for the future. Understanding the differences helps you maximize your savings.

## 401(k) Plans

### What is a 401(k)?
An employer-sponsored retirement plan that lets you contribute pre-tax dollars from your paycheck.

### Key Features
- **Contribution Limit (2024):** $23,000 ($30,500 if age 50+)
- **Tax Treatment:** Pre-tax contributions, tax-deferred growth
- **Employer Match:** Many employers match contributions (free money!)
- **Withdrawals:** Taxed as ordinary income in retirement
- **Early Withdrawal:** 10% penalty before age 59½ (with exceptions)

### Employer Match Example
If your employer offers 50% match up to 6%:
- Your salary: $100,000
- You contribute 6% ($6,000)
- Employer adds 50% of that ($3,000)
- Total contribution: $9,000

**Always contribute enough to get the full match—it's an immediate 50-100% return!**

### Roth 401(k)
- After-tax contributions
- Tax-free growth and withdrawals
- Same contribution limits as traditional 401(k)
- Good if you expect higher taxes in retirement

## Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)

### Traditional IRA

**Key Features:**
- **Contribution Limit (2024):** $7,000 ($8,000 if age 50+)
- **Tax Treatment:** Potentially tax-deductible contributions

### Roth IRA

**Key Features:**
- **Contribution Limit (2024):** $7,000 ($8,000 if age 50+)
- **Tax Treatment:** After-tax contributions (no deduction)

- No contribution: MAGI over $161,000

### Backdoor Roth IRA
If your income exceeds Roth limits:
1. Contribute to Traditional IRA (non-deductible)
2. Convert to Roth IRA
3. Pay taxes on any gains
4. Result: Roth IRA despite high income

*Note: Pro-rata rule applies if you have other traditional IRA balances*

## Traditional vs. Roth: Decision Framework

### Choose Traditional If:
- You're in a high tax bracket now
- You expect lower taxes in retirement
- You need the tax deduction now
- Your employer matches only traditional 401(k)

### Choose Roth If:
- You're in a low tax bracket now
- You expect higher taxes in retirement
- You want tax-free withdrawals in retirement
- You want to avoid RMDs

### When in Doubt:
Consider splitting between both (tax diversification).

## Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

Starting at age 73, you must withdraw from traditional accounts:

**RMD Calculation:**
```
RMD = Account Balance (Dec 31 prior year) / Life Expectancy Factor
```

**2024 Life Expectancy Factors (Sample):**
| Age | Factor |
|-----|--------|
| 73 | 26.5 |
| 75 | 24.6 |
| 80 | 20.2 |
| 85 | 16.0 |

**Penalty for missing RMD:** 25% of amount not withdrawn

### Roth IRAs and RMDs
- Roth IRAs have NO RMDs during owner's lifetime
- Inherited Roth IRAs do have RMDs (for non-spouse beneficiaries)

## Optimal Order of Contributions

1. **401(k) up to employer match** (free money)
2. **Pay off high-interest debt** (if any)
3. **Max out Roth IRA** (if eligible)
4. **Max out 401(k)** (remaining contribution room)
5. **HSA** (if eligible—triple tax advantage)
6. **Taxable brokerage account** (after maxing tax-advantaged)

## Early Withdrawal Exceptions

You can avoid the 10% penalty for:
- Age 59½ or older
- Death or disability
- Qualified first-time home purchase (IRA only, $10,000 limit)
- Qualified education expenses (IRA only)
- Substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP/72(t))
- Medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI
- Health insurance while unemployed (IRA only)
- 401(k) after separating from employer at age 55+

## Account Consolidation

### Rolling Over Accounts
When changing jobs, you can:
1. Leave money in old 401(k) (if allowed)
2. Roll over to new employer's 401(k)
3. Roll over to IRA (Traditional or Roth via conversion)
4. Cash out (worst option—taxes and penalties)

**Direct vs. Indirect Rollover:**
- **Direct:** Money transfers directly between accounts (best)
- **Indirect:** You receive check, must deposit within 60 days

## Key Takeaways

1. Always get your full employer match
2. Roth vs. Traditional depends on your tax situation
3. Contribute as much as you can—compound growth is powerful
4. Consider tax diversification (both traditional and Roth)
5. Avoid early withdrawals if possible
6. Consolidate old 401(k)s to keep things simple
