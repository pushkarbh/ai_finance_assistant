# Understanding Market Indexes

## What is a Market Index?

A market index is a measurement of a section of the stock market. It's calculated from the prices of selected stocks and serves as a benchmark for market performance.

When news says "the market was up 2% today," they're usually referring to an index like the S&P 500.

## Major US Stock Indexes

### S&P 500

**What it is:** 500 largest US companies by market capitalization

**Key Facts:**
- Represents ~80% of US stock market value
- Market-cap weighted (larger companies have more influence)
- Includes companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon
- Most commonly referenced US market benchmark

**Historical Performance:**
- Average annual return: ~10% (since 1926)
- Includes dividends

### Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)

**What it is:** 30 large, prominent US companies

**Key Facts:**
- Oldest US index (created 1896)
- Price-weighted (higher stock prices have more influence)
- Limited to 30 stocks (narrow view)
- Includes blue-chip companies like Boeing, Goldman Sachs

**Limitation:** Less representative than S&P 500 due to only 30 stocks

### NASDAQ Composite

**What it is:** All stocks listed on NASDAQ exchange (~3,000+)

**Key Facts:**
- Tech-heavy (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta)
- Market-cap weighted
- More volatile than S&P 500
- Good measure of technology sector

### Russell 2000

**What it is:** 2,000 small-cap US companies

**Key Facts:**
- Small-cap benchmark
- Companies ranked 1,001-3,000 by market cap
- More volatile than large-cap indexes
- Can signal economic health (small companies affected first)

## Index Weighting Methods

### Market-Cap Weighted
Companies with higher market cap have more influence.

**Example (S&P 500):**
- Apple (~7% of index) affects index more than smaller companies
- If Apple rises 10%, it moves the index more than a small company rising 10%

**Pros:** Reflects actual market value
**Cons:** Concentrated in largest companies

### Price-Weighted
Companies with higher stock prices have more influence.

**Example (Dow Jones):**
- A $300 stock influences the index more than a $30 stock
- Stock splits can change index composition

**Pros:** Simple calculation
**Cons:** Stock price doesn't reflect company size

### Equal-Weighted
Every company has the same influence regardless of size.

**Example (S&P 500 Equal Weight - RSP):**
- Each of 500 companies = 0.2% of index
- Small companies have same impact as large ones

**Pros:** Better diversification
**Cons:** Overweights small companies

## International Indexes

### MSCI EAFE
- Europe, Australasia, Far East
- Developed international markets (excludes US)
- ~800 stocks from 21 countries

### MSCI Emerging Markets
- Developing economies
- China, India, Brazil, Taiwan, etc.
- Higher growth potential, higher risk

### FTSE 100 (UK)
- 100 largest UK companies
- London Stock Exchange

### Nikkei 225 (Japan)
- 225 major Japanese companies

## Bond Indexes

### Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index
- Broad US bond market benchmark

### Bloomberg US Treasury Index
- US government bonds only
- Safest fixed-income benchmark

## Why Indexes Matter to Individual Investors

### 1. Benchmarking Performance
Compare your portfolio to relevant indexes:
- Beat the S&P 500? You outperformed
- Lagged the S&P 500? You underperformed

### 2. Index Funds and ETFs
You can invest directly in indexes:
- VOO, SPY track S&P 500
- QQQ tracks NASDAQ 100
- VTI tracks total US market
- BND tracks bond market

### 3. Market Sentiment
Indexes show overall market direction:
- All indexes up = broad market rally
- Tech-heavy NASDAQ down, others flat = sector rotation

### 4. Economic Indicators
- Russell 2000 falling may signal economic concerns
- Rising indexes generally indicate economic optimism

## Index Performance Comparison (20-Year Average Returns)

| Index | Focus | Approx. Annual Return |
|-------|-------|----------------------|
| S&P 500 | Large-cap US | 9-10% |
| NASDAQ Composite | Tech-heavy | 11-12% |
| Russell 2000 | Small-cap US | 8-9% |
| MSCI EAFE | International Developed | 5-7% |
| MSCI Emerging Markets | International Developing | 6-8% |

*Past performance doesn't guarantee future results*

## Total Market vs. S&P 500

### S&P 500
- 500 largest companies
- Large-cap only
- ~80% of US market value

### Total Stock Market (VTI, ITOT)
- ~4,000 stocks
- Large, mid, and small-cap
- 100% of US market

**Difference:** Minimal. They're ~90% correlated. Total market adds small-cap exposure but S&P 500 performance is nearly identical.

## Common Index Misconceptions

### "I can buy the Dow"
You can't buy an index directly. You buy index funds or ETFs that track it.

### "The index is at an all-time high, so it's overvalued"
Indexes reach new highs regularly as the economy grows. All-time highs are normal in long-term uptrends.

### "A high Dow number means an expensive market"
Index levels aren't meaningful on their own. A Dow of 40,000 isn't "expensive" - what matters is the underlying company valuations.

## Key Index Funds for Beginners

| Index | ETF Options | Expense Ratio |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| S&P 500 | VOO, SPY, IVV | 0.03-0.09% |
| Total US Market | VTI, ITOT | 0.03% |
| NASDAQ 100 | QQQ, QQQM | 0.15-0.20% |
| Total International | VXUS, IXUS | 0.07-0.09% |
| Total Bond | BND, AGG | 0.03% |
