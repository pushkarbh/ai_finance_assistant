# Capital Gains and Investment Taxes

## What are Capital Gains?

A capital gain occurs when you sell an investment for more than you paid for it. The profit is called a "capital gain" and is subject to taxes.

**Example:**
- Buy stock for $1,000
- Sell stock for $1,500
- Capital gain: $500

## Types of Capital Gains

### Short-Term Capital Gains
Investments held for **one year or less**.

**Tax Rate:** Same as your ordinary income tax rate (10% to 37%)

### Long-Term Capital Gains
Investments held for **more than one year**.

**Tax Rates (2024):**
| Taxable Income (Single) | Rate |
|------------------------|------|
| Up to $47,025 | 0% |
| $47,025 - $518,900 | 15% |
| Over $518,900 | 20% |

**Key Insight:** Long-term rates are significantly lower than ordinary income rates.

## The One-Year Rule

**Hold investments for at least one year and one day** to qualify for long-term capital gains rates.

**Example of Tax Savings:**

You're in the 32% tax bracket with a $10,000 gain:
- Short-term (sold at 11 months): $3,200 in taxes
- Long-term (sold at 13 months): $1,500 in taxes
- **Savings: $1,700**

## Cost Basis Explained

Your cost basis is what you paid for an investment, used to calculate gains or losses.

### Simple Cost Basis
Purchase price plus any fees.

**Example:**
- Bought 100 shares at $50 = $5,000
- Commission: $10
- Cost basis: $5,010

### Adjusted Cost Basis
Includes additional investments, reinvested dividends, splits, etc.

**Example with Dividend Reinvestment:**
- Initial purchase: $5,000 (100 shares at $50)
- Reinvested dividends: $500 (10 shares at $50)
- Adjusted cost basis: $5,500 (110 shares)

## Tax-Loss Harvesting

Selling investments at a loss to offset gains.

### How It Works
1. Sell investment with a loss
2. Use loss to offset capital gains
3. If losses exceed gains, deduct up to $3,000 from ordinary income
4. Carry forward excess losses to future years

### Example
- Realized gains: $10,000
- Realized losses: $7,000
- Net taxable gain: $3,000

### Wash Sale Rule
**You cannot claim a loss if you buy the same or "substantially identical" security within 30 days before or after the sale.**

**Wash Sale Example:**
- Jan 15: Sell Stock A at $1,000 loss
- Jan 20: Buy Stock A back
- Result: Loss is disallowed (wash sale)

**Avoiding Wash Sales:**
- Wait 31 days before repurchasing
- Buy a similar but not identical fund (e.g., switch from one S&P 500 ETF to another)

## Dividends and Taxes

### Qualified Dividends
Most dividends from US companies held 60+ days.
- Taxed at long-term capital gains rates (0%, 15%, 20%)

### Non-Qualified (Ordinary) Dividends
- REITs, money market funds, short-term holdings
- Taxed as ordinary income

## Tax-Advantaged Accounts

### Tax-Deferred (Traditional 401k, IRA)
- No taxes on gains while invested
- Withdrawals taxed as ordinary income
- Great for tax-loss harvesting assets you'd normally sell

### Tax-Free (Roth 401k, Roth IRA)
- No taxes on gains ever
- No taxes on withdrawals
- Hold highest-growth assets here

### Taxable Brokerage
- Gains taxed when realized
- Use tax-efficient strategies
- Hold tax-efficient investments here

## Tax-Efficient Investing Strategies

### Asset Location
Place investments in the most tax-efficient account:

| Asset Type | Best Account |
|------------|--------------|
| REITs | Tax-deferred (high dividends) |
| Bonds | Tax-deferred (interest is ordinary income) |
| Growth stocks | Roth (maximize tax-free growth) |
| Index funds | Taxable (tax-efficient) |

### Hold for Long-Term
Avoid short-term capital gains by holding over one year.

### Use Index Funds in Taxable Accounts
- Low turnover = fewer taxable events
- ETFs are more tax-efficient than mutual funds

### Harvest Losses Strategically
- End of year tax-loss harvesting
- Offset gains with losses
- Don't let tax tail wag the investment dog

## Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)

Additional 3.8% tax on investment income for high earners.

**Applies to:**
- Single filers with MAGI over $200,000
- Married filing jointly over $250,000

**Total Maximum Rate:** 20% + 3.8% = 23.8%

## State Taxes

Many states also tax capital gains:
- California: Up to 13.3%
- New York: Up to 10.9%
- Florida: 0%
- Texas: 0%

**Total tax burden varies significantly by state.**

## Reporting Investment Taxes

### Form 1099-B
Brokerages send this form reporting:
- Proceeds from sales
- Cost basis (if known)
- Short-term vs. long-term

### Form 8949
Used to report capital gains and losses in detail.

### Schedule D
Summary of capital gains and losses attached to Form 1040.

## Common Tax Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting About Wash Sales
Buying back too soon invalidates your loss.

### 2. Ignoring Dividend Reinvestment in Cost Basis
Each reinvestment adds to your cost basis.

### 3. Not Harvesting Losses
Letting losses go unrealized when they could offset gains.

### 4. Selling Too Soon
Missing long-term rates by not waiting one year.

### 5. Not Using Tax-Advantaged Accounts
Paying unnecessary taxes on investments.

## Key Takeaways
