# Dollar-Cost Averaging: A Beginner's Best Friend

## What is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)?

Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. Instead of trying to time the market, you invest consistently over time.

## How DCA Works

**Example: Investing $500 monthly in an S&P 500 index fund**

| Month | Amount | Price/Share | Shares Bought |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Jan | $500 | $100 | 5.0 |
| Feb | $500 | $90 | 5.56 |
| Mar | $500 | $80 | 6.25 |
| Apr | $500 | $95 | 5.26 |
| May | $500 | $110 | 4.55 |
| Jun | $500 | $105 | 4.76 |

**Total Invested:** $3,000
**Total Shares:** 31.38
**Average Cost:** $95.60/share

Notice: You bought more shares when prices were low and fewer when high. This naturally lowers your average cost.

## DCA vs. Lump Sum Investing

### Lump Sum
Investing all your money at once.

**Pros:**
- Historically higher returns (market tends to go up)
- Money is invested longer
- Simpler—one decision

**Cons:**
- Potential for bad timing
- Emotionally difficult if market drops right after
- Requires large sum available

### Dollar-Cost Averaging
**Pros:**
- Removes timing decisions
- Reduces emotional stress
- Automatic and disciplined
- Great for regular income (paychecks)

**Cons:**
- May underperform lump sum in rising markets
- Takes time to fully deploy capital
- Potential opportunity cost

### The Data
Studies show lump sum investing outperforms DCA about 2/3 of the time. However, DCA reduces volatility and anxiety, making it easier to stay invested.

## The Psychology Behind DCA

### Why It Works Emotionally

1. **Removes Decision Fatigue:** No agonizing over when to invest
2. **Reduces Regret:** Less likely to feel you "bought at the top"
3. **Builds Discipline:** Automatic investing becomes habit
4. **Handles Volatility:** Market drops feel like "buying on sale"

### Behavioral Benefits
- Overcomes analysis paralysis
- Prevents panic selling
- Encourages long-term thinking
- Makes investing routine, not stressful

## Implementing DCA

### In a 401(k)
Your 401(k) already uses DCA! Every paycheck, a fixed amount is invested automatically.

### In a Brokerage or IRA
Set up automatic investments:
1. Link bank account to brokerage
2. Choose investment (index fund, ETF)
3. Set amount and frequency (weekly, monthly)
4. Enable automatic reinvestment of dividends

### Choosing Your Frequency
| Frequency | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| Weekly | Those who want to smooth more |
| Bi-weekly | Matching paychecks |
| Monthly | Most common, simple |
| Quarterly | Larger amounts |

## DCA Examples in Practice

### New Investor with $10,000
**Option 1: Lump Sum**
- Invest $10,000 immediately
- If market drops 20%, you're down $2,000

**Option 2: DCA over 10 months**
- Invest $1,000 monthly
- If market drops in months 2-5, you buy more at lower prices
- Reduces risk of bad timing

### Regular Income Investor
- Salary: $6,000/month
- Investment goal: $1,000/month (16.7% savings rate)
- Set automatic monthly transfer to brokerage
- Dollar-cost average for your entire career

### 401(k) Contribution
- Annual salary: $100,000
- Contribution: 10% ($10,000/year)
- Per paycheck (bi-weekly): $385
- Natural DCA: 26 investments per year

## When DCA Makes the Most Sense

1. **Regular income from paychecks**
2. **Long time horizon** (10+ years)
3. **Nervous about market volatility**
4. **Building investment habit**
5. **Don't have large lump sum**

## When Lump Sum May Be Better

1. **Windfall (inheritance, bonus)**
2. **Market has been down significantly**
3. **Very long time horizon**
4. **Comfortable with volatility**
5. **Statistically optimal (on average)**

## DCA Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Stopping During Downturns
The worst thing you can do is stop investing when prices are low. That's when you get the most shares for your money!

### 2. Not Starting Because the Market is "High"
Markets reach new highs regularly. Waiting for a pullback means potentially missing gains.

### 3. Inconsistent Amounts
The power of DCA comes from consistency. Varying amounts defeats the purpose.

### 4. Not Reinvesting Dividends
Set dividends to automatically reinvest—that's additional DCA.

### 5. Using DCA as an Excuse
If you have money to invest, don't use DCA to procrastinate. A reasonable DCA period is 6-12 months max.

## DCA + Rebalancing

Combine DCA with portfolio rebalancing:
1. Set target allocation (e.g., 70% stocks, 30% bonds)
2. Direct new contributions to underweight asset
3. Natural rebalancing through purchases
4. Reduces need for selling (and taxes)

## The Math of Buying More When Prices Drop

**Why DCA Lowers Average Cost:**

If you invest $1,000 monthly:
- Month 1: Price $100, buy 10 shares
- Month 2: Price $50, buy 20 shares

**Total:** $2,000 for 30 shares
**Average cost:** $66.67/share

Even though the average *price* was $75, your average *cost* is $66.67 because you bought more shares at the lower price.

## Key Takeaways

1. DCA means investing fixed amounts at regular intervals
2. It removes the stress of market timing
3. Particularly powerful during volatile markets
4. Your 401(k) likely already uses this strategy
5. Automation is key—set it and forget it
6. Don't stop during market downturns
7. For lump sums, consider DCA over 6-12 months if nervous
