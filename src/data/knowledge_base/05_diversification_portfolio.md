# Portfolio Diversification: The Key to Managing Risk

## What is Diversification?

Diversification is an investment strategy that spreads your money across different assets to reduce risk. The principle is simple: don't put all your eggs in one basket.

## Why Diversification Works

Different investments respond differently to market conditions:
- When stocks fall, bonds often rise
- When US markets struggle, international markets may do well
- When growth stocks decline, value stocks may hold steady

By owning a mix, your portfolio doesn't depend on any single investment's success.

## The Math Behind Diversification

### Correlation
Correlation measures how investments move together:
- **+1:** Move in perfect lockstep
- **0:** No relationship
- **-1:** Move in opposite directions

**Ideal diversification:** Combine assets with low or negative correlation.

### Example of Correlation
| Asset Pair | Correlation |
|------------|-------------|
| US Large-Cap & US Small-Cap | +0.85 |
| US Stocks & International Stocks | +0.65 |
| US Stocks & US Bonds | -0.10 to +0.20 |
| Stocks & Gold | ~0 |

## Levels of Diversification

### 1. Within Asset Classes
**Stock Diversification:**
- Different sectors (tech, healthcare, finance)
- Different sizes (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap)
- Different styles (growth, value)
- Different regions (US, international, emerging markets)

**Bond Diversification:**
- Government vs. corporate
- Short-term vs. long-term
- Different credit qualities

### 2. Across Asset Classes
- Stocks (growth potential)
- Bonds (stability and income)
- Real estate (REITs)
- Cash/money market (liquidity)
- Commodities (inflation hedge)

### 3. Geographic Diversification
- US markets (~60% of global market cap)
- Developed international (Europe, Japan, Australia)
- Emerging markets (China, India, Brazil)

## Asset Allocation Models

### Conservative (Low Risk)
- 30% Stocks
- 60% Bonds
- 10% Cash

### Moderate (Balanced)
- 60% Stocks
- 35% Bonds
- 5% Cash

### Aggressive (High Growth)
- 85% Stocks
- 10% Bonds
- 5% Cash

## Sample Diversified Portfolios

### Three-Fund Portfolio
A simple, effective approach:
1. **Total US Stock Market (40%)** - VTI or VTSAX
2. **Total International Stock (20%)** - VXUS or VTIAX
3. **Total US Bond Market (40%)** - BND or VBTLX

### Target-Date Fund
One-fund solution that automatically rebalances:
- Adjusts allocation as you approach retirement
- More aggressive when young, more conservative when older
- Example: Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 (VFIFX)

### Five-Fund Portfolio
More control over allocation:
1. US Large-Cap (30%)
2. US Small-Cap (10%)
3. International Developed (15%)
4. Emerging Markets (5%)
5. US Bonds (40%)

## Diversification Metrics

### Number of Holdings
- Individual stocks: 20-30 minimum for basic diversification
- Index fund: One fund can hold thousands of stocks

### Sector Allocation
Avoid concentration in any single sector:
| Sector | S&P 500 Weight (Approx.) |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Technology | 25-30% |
| Healthcare | 12-15% |
| Financials | 10-13% |
| Consumer Discretionary | 10-12% |
| Communication | 8-10% |
| Industrials | 8-10% |
| Consumer Staples | 6-8% |
| Energy | 4-6% |
| Other | 10-15% |

## Common Diversification Mistakes

### 1. Over-Diversification
- Owning too many overlapping funds
- Example: S&P 500 fund + Total Market fund = redundant

### 2. False Diversification
- Owning 10 tech stocks isn't diversified
- Multiple funds in the same category isn't diversified

### 3. Home Country Bias
- Americans often have 0% international exposure
- International stocks are ~40% of global market

### 4. Employer Stock Concentration
- RSUs can create dangerous concentration
- Remember Enron employees who lost everything

### 5. Ignoring Correlation Changes
- Correlations increase during market crashes
- When you need diversification most, it may help least

## Rebalancing Your Portfolio

### Why Rebalance?
Over time, winners grow and losers shrink, changing your allocation.

**Example:**
- Start: 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- After bull market: 75% stocks, 25% bonds
- Rebalance back to 60/40

### How to Rebalance
1. **Calendar-based:** Rebalance quarterly or annually
2. **Threshold-based:** Rebalance when allocation drifts 5%+
3. **Combination:** Check quarterly, act if needed

### Tax-Efficient Rebalancing
- Use new contributions to buy underweight assets
- Rebalance in tax-advantaged accounts (401k, IRA) first
- Consider tax-loss harvesting opportunities

## The Efficient Frontier

Modern Portfolio Theory suggests there's an optimal mix of assets that:
- Maximizes return for a given level of risk, OR
- Minimizes risk for a given level of return

This "efficient frontier" is why diversification isn't just about reducing risk—it can also improve returns.

## Diversification Limits

Diversification **reduces** but doesn't **eliminate** risk:
- **Systematic risk (market risk):** Affects all investments, can't be diversified away
- **Unsystematic risk (company risk):** Can be reduced through diversification

In a market crash, nearly everything falls together.

## Key Takeaways

1. Spread investments across different asset types
2. Include both US and international investments
3. Use low-cost index funds for instant diversification
4. Rebalance periodically to maintain target allocation
5. Avoid concentration in employer stock
6. Diversification is about risk management, not maximizing returns
