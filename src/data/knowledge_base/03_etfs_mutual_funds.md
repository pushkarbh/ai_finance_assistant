# ETFs and Mutual Funds: A Complete Comparison

## What is a Mutual Fund?

A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities.

### How Mutual Funds Work
1. Investors buy shares in the fund
2. Professional fund managers invest the pooled money
3. Returns (gains, losses, dividends) are distributed to shareholders
4. Shares are priced once daily at market close (NAV)

### Types of Mutual Funds
- **Stock Funds:** Invest primarily in stocks
- **Bond Funds:** Invest in fixed-income securities
- **Money Market Funds:** Invest in short-term, low-risk securities
- **Balanced Funds:** Mix of stocks and bonds
- **Index Funds:** Track a specific market index
- **Target-Date Funds:** Automatically adjust allocation based on retirement date

## What is an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)?

An ETF is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, similar to individual stocks. ETFs typically track an index, sector, commodity, or other assets.

### How ETFs Work
1. ETFs hold a basket of underlying assets
2. Shares trade throughout the day on exchanges
3. Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand
4. Can be bought and sold like stocks

### Types of ETFs
- **Index ETFs:** Track market indexes (S&P 500, NASDAQ)
- **Sector ETFs:** Focus on specific industries
- **Bond ETFs:** Hold fixed-income securities
- **Commodity ETFs:** Track commodities like gold
- **International ETFs:** Focus on foreign markets
- **Thematic ETFs:** Target specific trends (AI, clean energy)

## ETFs vs. Mutual Funds: Key Differences

| Feature | ETFs | Mutual Funds |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Trading | Throughout the day | Once daily at NAV |
| Minimum Investment | Price of one share | Often $1,000-$3,000 |
| Expense Ratios | Generally lower | Can be higher |
| Tax Efficiency | More efficient | Less efficient |
| Management | Often passive | Active or passive |
| Transparency | Daily holdings | Monthly/quarterly |

## Expense Ratios Explained

The expense ratio is the annual fee charged by a fund, expressed as a percentage of assets.

**Example:**
- Fund value: $10,000
- Expense ratio: 0.20%
- Annual cost: $20

### Typical Expense Ratios
- Index ETFs: 0.03% - 0.20%
- Index Mutual Funds: 0.10% - 0.50%
- Actively Managed Funds: 0.50% - 1.50%+

**Impact Over Time:**
A 1% difference in fees on $100,000 over 30 years (at 7% return) costs you approximately $150,000!

## Popular Index Funds and ETFs

### S&P 500 Tracking
- **VOO** (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF): 0.03% expense ratio
- **SPY** (SPDR S&P 500 ETF): 0.09% expense ratio
- **VFIAX** (Vanguard 500 Index Fund): 0.04% expense ratio

### Total Stock Market
- **VTI** (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF): 0.03% expense ratio
- **ITOT** (iShares Core S&P Total US Stock Market): 0.03% expense ratio

### International
- **VXUS** (Vanguard Total International Stock ETF): 0.08% expense ratio
- **IXUS** (iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock): 0.09% expense ratio

### Bonds
- **BND** (Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF): 0.03% expense ratio
- **AGG** (iShares Core US Aggregate Bond): 0.03% expense ratio

## Active vs. Passive Management

### Passive Management (Index Funds)
- Track a market index
- Lower fees
- Match market returns
- Less trading, more tax-efficient
- Studies show most active managers underperform indexes long-term

### Active Management
- Fund managers try to beat the market
- Higher fees
- Potential for outperformance (but rare consistently)
- More trading, potentially less tax-efficient

## Tax Efficiency

### Why ETFs Are Often More Tax-Efficient
- **Creation/Redemption Process:** ETFs use in-kind transfers that avoid triggering capital gains
- **Lower Turnover:** Index-tracking ETFs trade less frequently
- **No Forced Distributions:** You control when you sell

### Mutual Fund Tax Issues
- **Capital Gains Distributions:** Even if you don't sell, you may owe taxes
- **Year-End Surprises:** Funds may distribute gains in December
- **New Investor Penalty:** Buying before a distribution means paying taxes on gains you didn't earn

## Which Should You Choose?

### Choose ETFs If:
- You want to trade during market hours
- Tax efficiency is important (taxable accounts)
- You prefer lower expense ratios
- You're making smaller, regular investments

### Choose Mutual Funds If:
- You want automatic investments
- You prefer dealing in dollar amounts, not shares
- You're using a 401(k) with limited options
- You want target-date retirement funds

### The Simple Answer for Most Beginners:
Low-cost index funds (either ETF or mutual fund) tracking broad market indexes are excellent choices for long-term investors.

## Building a Simple Portfolio

### Three-Fund Portfolio Example
1. **US Total Stock Market (60%):** VTI or VTSAX
2. **International Stocks (25%):** VXUS or VTIAX
3. **US Bonds (15%):** BND or VBTLX

This simple approach provides broad diversification at very low cost.
